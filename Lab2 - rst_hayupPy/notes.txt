** NOTE **

Run python file in VSCODE with the Script folder opened to avoid any issues with the CWD(Current Working Directory)

When using telnet, the IOU Web Interface will connect you to the line console 0 of the specified device, which means only 1 connection is allowed.
When running the python script make sure there no established connections to any of the device in RSTLab.
